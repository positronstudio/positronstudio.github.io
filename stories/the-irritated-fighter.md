## The Irritated Fighter

It was almost morning. The clear skies meant good visibility. That would give the king's men a good view and allow them to witness his prowess in battle, maybe they'd learn something.

'These boys better not get in my way' he thought while a servant girl tied little purple ribbons to his armor. He liked the ribbons. They made him look royal, or at least that's what he said to himself when he made his list of requirements to his employers, often a king or a noble with a difficult-to-solve problem. Problems that needed an unbeatable fighter to solve.

This unbeatable fighter had a long list of requirements that included things like silk undergarments, silk footwraps, silk shirts, he wouldn't mind armor made out of silk if the regular ones didn't look so impressive. And he'd ask for the most impressive armor there was, and always had it fitted to him perfectly. He explained that he had sensitive skin that would chafe in regular linens and the slightest issue with footwear would give him blisters. Nobody believed him of course, knowing of all the battles he'd been through unscathed, but nobody dared to say anything.

The other soldiers in the camp didn't mind if their greaves didn't fit perfectly, or that they'd have chafes here and there after the battle. As long as they survived. That day their comfort was the fact that they had an undefeated hero on their side. That would improve their odds of surviving a lot. Mere months ago, before they had such a fearsome ally they'd lose too many men each battle, while the enemy seemed to have an infinite amount of troops. Few veterans remained in fighting condition except for the captain. A great leader and a good fighter for a man pushing 50, he was glad to be able to rely on the hero, who did the work of hundreds of soldiers without the associated risk of losses. He wanted to express his gratitude as he walked towards the fanciest tent of the camp.

'Good day, sir!'

'Greetings, young man.' responded the hero, looking into the distance without checking with whom he was speaking, not that he would care.

'I... I want to say to you how much we appreciate your help. Since you arrived the men have hope again. They fight with conviction, knowing that they have you at their side. If you could speak to them they'd be even more --'

'Stop.' the hero interrupted. 'I wasn't hired to speak to soldiers. I'm known throughout the realm as an undefeated fighter, not as an undefeated speaker. In fact, I will add to my list of requirements that I will only be asked to fight, and not speak, unless it is the type of speaking that is likely to devolve into fighting.'

'I apologize.' said the captain as he bowed, somewhat disheartened.

'I see you are their leader. Perhaps you'll want to know that the reason I'm helping you is that I like the combat. I have no conviction, like your men do, and the gold is fair, but I have little use for more. Still, if the victuals would be any less delectable, the garments any less comfortable, or you any more annoying you would be fighting on your own.'

The captain withdrew. He was wise enough not to jeopardize their only chance at victory.

### SOME TIME LATER ON THE BATTLEFIELD

Hordes of green and brown humanoid creatures wearing mostly loincloths and wielding rough weapons rushed towards the hero. At the last possible moment he drew his sword and sliced through 5 creatures at once, spinning in the air for a short moment, just enough for 5 more enemies to get into range. He sliced through those as well. This went on for some time as the soldiers cheered more than they fought. They also didn't mind that the creatures were drawn towards the main combatant rather than to them.

While this was going on, a number of enemies were waiting on a nearby hill, observing the battle. They were unusual in that they were wearing headgear with a large plume on top, had decently sharp swords and were riding some kind of ostrich. Likely of a higher rank than the common soldiers around then, they were studying the hero, and had been doing so ever since he started fighting for the kingdom. He noticed. They noticed he noticed, panicked and turned around, ready to flee, but the hero was upon them. With barely three movements of his sword he took down four creatures and one ostrich. The air was filled with gurgling sounds and fibers from the plumes and feathers. The enemy foot-soldiers didn't stop at all while this was happening, until...

'ACHOO!'

Everyone stopped.

The sneeze was the first thing the hero did in battle that was not killing something, or some display of acrobatics that ended with killing something. Then he rubbed his nose. Then the creatures attacked.

### AFTER THE BATTLE IN THE CAMP

'Sir, are you all right?' the captain inquired of the hero.

'Ha, are you concerned for me? I'm invincible!'

It was true. What ever happened did not reduce his fighting capabilities at all.

'Still, get me some ointment, will you?' the hero continued while scratching his beard.

The captain motioned to a servant and went on:

'Is there anything we should know?'

'I'm allergic to those damned feathers.'

'WHAT? We must take care to avoid getting you exposed! We must make preparations at once!'

'Stop.' was the familiar interruption. 'It's not a serious allergy, I don't stop breathing or fall down dead, I just get a little itchy, a runny nose and such. Now where's that ointment?'

The captain was no less concerned, but he knew not to bother the temperamental hero any longer.

### MEANWHILE IN A DARK DUNGEON IN A DARK TOWER

A map of the kingdom laid on a large table in the middle of a poorly lit room.

'Master, I am certain we just need to keep sending more troops, he will be bored eventually. We have no shortage of combatants.' said a whiny voice.

'Hmmm.' replied a deep voice.

'If only we could convince your brother to share the secrets of his powder, the one he used to scare him away in the neighboring kingdom.' complained one whiny voice to another.

'He didn't say he was scared. I think upset was the word, maybe irritated.'

A small creature, out of breath from running a long way, burst into the room and thrust its hand forward, offering a parchment to whomever would take it. The two owners of the whiny voices reached for the parchment and struggled until one of them grabbed it and scampered towards a candle.

'He... He sneezed.'

'So he caught a cold.'

'No, he's never caught a cold before. At least I've never heard of him being sick.'

'This isn't helpful at all!'

'There must be a reason, this must mean something. It says he killed four officers before he sneezed. And an ostrich.'

'Maybe he's allergic to killing officers. Maybe we can send all our officers and he'll sneeze himself away.'

'Do they need to have been officers before, or can we just promote everyone to officer?'

The owner of the deep voice stamped his foot and got up from the throne he was sitting in. He grabbed the headgear from the scout who was still in the room and pulled the plume off of it, holding it up to the light.

'Hmmm.'

### THE NEXT DAY AT THE CAMP

'Sir, you must allow us to watch out for you. At least have some men follow you with ointment ready.'

'Captain! Do you remember when we spoke yesterday about you annoying me?'

The Captain thought for a moment before replying.

'How about we send some of our best men around you, to drive away those birds and their riders?'

'You mean drive away the best part of the fight?'

'No, sir! You know what happens when those feathers fly everywhere. I just want this to be a pleasant experience for you.'

'I suppose...' the hero conceded. 'But your men mustn't get in my way, and once there are no more feathered creatures on the battlefield, I expect no more of this nonsense.'

'Of course, sir!'

A war horn sounded, signifying enemy approach.

'What? They never arrive this early.'

The men were in line and prepared when the first enemies could be seen crossing over a hill near the battlefield. It was an odd sight. Hordes of creatures of varying sizes were running down the hill, some wearing hats with familiar plumes stuck in them, others with feathers simply tied to their heads with string. The smaller enemies had what might have been chicken feathers stuck to their arms and legs. Some didn't even have weapons, they just carried large plumes or bunches of feathers in each hand.

The captain sighed and looked at the hero, who's face seemed at the same time angry and upset, definitely irritated. The once unbeatable fighter threw his sword at the ground and walked away.
